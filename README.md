# IITM JAVA ASSIGNMENT

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments for the Java course at IIT Madras. Each assignment is organized by week, and the code is written in Java. 

## Structure
- Each week has its own folder (e.g., `Week_1/`), containing the Java files for that week's assignments.
- Example: `Week_1/GRPA1.java`

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/IITM-JAVA-ASSIGNMENT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired week's folder.
3. Compile and run the Java files using your preferred Java IDE or the command line:
   ```sh
   javac GRPA1.java
   java GRPA1
   ```

## Notes
- All code is for educational purposes and follows the guidelines of the IITM Java course.
- Feel free to use these solutions as a reference, but do not copy them directly for submission.
